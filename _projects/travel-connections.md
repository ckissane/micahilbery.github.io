### Overview

Travel Connections is a small travel agency based out of Greenville, Illinois. The owner, Diane, started Travel Connections in 1996 because she had a passion for travel and wanted to share this passion with others by providing a full range of travel services. Today, Travel Connections prides itself on providing personalized service through the entire travel process. Travel Connections has grown from one person's passion to having several travel agents with different specialties.

### Objectives

While Travel Connections offers expert travel consultation, their website had gotten thrown to the back burner. Their current site was several years old and outdated. Since the site was originally created, Travel Connections has added additonal travel agents to their roster, the links to their affiliated travel partners had not been updated and many of them did not work when clicked on, the site did not meet standard accessiblity guidelines, and they wanted a fresh branding package with colors that better complemented each other, versus the dark blue and stark pink that was currently being used. Travel Connections' website was also not responsive, and with so many people now using mobile and tablet devices, having a website that does not cater to those devices made the site hard to navigate and the experience frustrating. Like any small business, Travel Connections is looking to expand their customer base and an updated website is a great start.

### Approach

First I started by creating new branding. I chose a more muted but still colorfull palette to replace the blues and pink in the original. After that I started sketching and began updating the desing to me more modern and responsive. Information updates were done with the links, to make sure they all worked, and in the staff section, as several travel agents had been hired since the site was originally created. Now, Travel Connections has a website that is easily navigated, has links that work, and business information that is correct.
